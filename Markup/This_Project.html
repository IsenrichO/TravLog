			<h2>Intro & Motivations</h2>
			<p>This project is, first and foremost, an outgrowth of my aims toward advancing my own skills in web development. To that end, I see Hack Reactor — upon whom's directive I have been asked to work on the present project — as what may potentially be my greatest resource for maintaining that trajectory. And even though the impetus to take on this project wasn't out of purely personal motivations, I also won't say I'm unhappy with the circumstances. To clarify... this is the proverbial gatekeeper that stands between me (<i>read</i>: my personal station in life) and where I would ultimately like to be. Hack Reactor is the vessel through which I effect that transformation. Or such are my beliefs. And although it is something I have been formally asked to do, it would be inaccurate to say there's no personal investment in it at the same time. (Why should work and fun be mutually exclusive, amirite?)</p>

			<h2>Starting Out</h2>
			<p>Reflecting on my performance following my original interview, I would say the admissions decision was largely along the lines of what I expected. If nothing else, there is at least a bit of a silver lining in that the project forced upon me an exposure to many of the more foreign facets that defines what being a "programmer" is. To Hack Reactor's credit, they are rightfully vocal about the hidden dangers that come with a heavy reliance on MOOCs or other web-based instructional media (<i>i.e.</i>, CodeCademy, Code School, Treehouse, Udemy, Udacity, <i>etc.</i>). Of course, this isn't to say they are without value; in fact, for those to whom programming is a relatively novel experience, few things as expedient or effective in helping to: <span style="font-weight: bold;">1.)</span> give aspiring developers a feel for code (or just a language-specific syntax), as well as in <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.)</span> providing a gentle, appropriately-portioned foray into a world of information that otherwise is prone to leaving people with feelings of disengage to something is otherwise prone to disengaging people or producing a sense of overwhelmedness. That said, it also merits noting that there's no Code School course for walking you through the assignments your boss gave you. So, until they do make one, I suppose having a go at a project of your own is about as good of preparatoin for the professional career counterpart as any.</p>
