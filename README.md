# TravLog
<h3>Personal Trip Logger &amp; Itinerary Planner</h3>

<h5><em>A developing project borne of a personal passion for travel and a want to share that with others.</em></h5>
<br />
This app leverages the power of Google's lesser-known Fusion Tables API atop the widespread Google Maps JavaScript (JS) API. The confluence of the two creates an interactive Maps application upon which a visual layer is built... a layer that allows you to see where you have traveled, where you want to travel or to simply identify exotic destinations from within the broader global context/scale.

<br /> <br />

Data used in the construction of this visual overlay is borrowed from an open-sourced Fusion Table in which is contained .KML geocoded location data for just about every country on the globe. Vector images used to display orthographic projections and national flags have been taken almost entirely from WikiMedia Commons.
