# TravLog
Personal Trip Logger &amp; Itinerary Planner

A developing project borne of a personal passion for travel and a want to share that with others. 

This app leverages the power of Google's lesser-known Fusion Tables API atop the widespread Google Maps JavaScript (JS) API. The confluence of the two creates an interactive Maps application upon which a visual layer is built... a layer that allows you to see where you have traveled, where you want to travel or just to exotic destinations which you'd like to clearly identify from within the greater global context/scale.

Enjoy!
